# Customer_Segmentation_Analysis
This project was performed with MysqlWorkbench to showcase my sql skills for data cleaning, data transformation and use of joins. After preparing the dataset on MysqlWorkbench I exported the finished table with the columns I needed as a csv file which contained a total of 23,040 rows and 11 columns for visualization on power bi. I used power bi to create a new table for RFM analysis, writing dax measures, data modelling and visaualization. For more details use the links below:
